## TASK1

your task is to apply classification on one of the famous data set called breast_cancer 
at the first you will apply any classification algorithm and then evalute the model 
then you need to apply PCA with 10 components and apply the same algorithm 
then apply the PCA with 2 Components and pply the same algorithm 
and compare between the evalution of three models

1- classification without PCA

2- classification with PCA 10 components

3- classification with PCA 2 components


## TASK2

your task is to apply classification on one of the famous data set called cifar10 
at the first you will apply any classification algorithm and 
then evalute the model then you need to apply PCA with 10 components 
and apply the same algorithm then apply the PCA with 2 Components and pply the same algorithm 
and compare between the evalution of three models

1- classification without PCA

2- classification with PCA 10 components

3- classification with PCA 2 components


you can explore data from here https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

To load the data run the following lines of code:

!pip install keras
from keras.datasets import cifar10
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = cifar10.load_data()

---------------------
Then u can train the models and evaluate
